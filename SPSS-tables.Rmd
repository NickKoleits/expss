Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r table1, echo=FALSE}

```

```{r export-to-excel, echo=FALSE}

# # export tables to Excel
# wb = createWorkbook()
# sh = addWorksheet(wb, "Tables")
# xl_write(tab, wb, sh)
# saveWorkbook(wb, "outputs/table1.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
